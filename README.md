# Cause-of-Deaths-Among-Children-under-age-of-5
This repository contains a supervised learning model designed to classify causes of death based on the GDP of a country and predict the number of deaths.
Child mortality remains a significant issue, particularly in lower-income countries. This report investigates the relationship between economic status and child mortality using a dataset covering 204 countries over 30 years (1990-2019), including GDP data and causes of child deaths. Advanced machine learning models—Random Forest, Bagging with Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting classifiers—identify patterns and key health factors influencing GDP classification. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of economic conditions impacting child mortality, revealing which health factors are most closely associated with economic status. The analysis involves data preparation, model fitting, and performance evaluation using supervised learning. The primary goal is to determine if lower GDP countries have higher child mortality rates from specific causes compared to wealthier nations. These insights can help policymakers develop strategies to reduce child mortality rates and improve health outcomes for children.
